var searchCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "search [pattern]",
	Short: "Search for tags, modules, attributes, and other elements by keyword or regex pattern",
	Long: `Search through the custom elements manifest for any element matching the given pattern.

The search pattern is treated as a regular expression by default, allowing for powerful
and flexible searches. If the regex is invalid, it falls back to literal string matching.

The search looks through names, descriptions, summaries, and labels of all manifest items
including tags, modules, attributes, slots, CSS properties, CSS states, CSS parts, events,
methods, demos, functions, variables, and more.

Examples:

  cem search button                    # Find anything containing "button"  
  cem search "^my-.*button$"           # Regex: elements starting with "my-" and ending with "button"
  cem search "click|hover"             # Regex: elements containing "click" OR "hover"
  cem search --format tree deprecated  # Search for "deprecated" and show as tree
  cem search "css.*property"           # Find CSS-related properties
  cem search "slot.*header"            # Find header-related slots
