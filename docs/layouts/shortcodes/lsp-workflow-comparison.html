{{/*
  Real-world workflow benchmarks removed.

  These tests were dominated by artificial delays (50ms-2000ms waits) rather than
  actual LSP performance, making the results misleading. The "Core Operations"
  benchmarks provide pure LSP protocol timing without Neovim overhead.

  See: docs/content/docs/benchmarks.md for current LSP benchmarks
