Practice TDD.

Getter methods should be named Foo(), not GetFoo().

When writing tests, always write use the fixture/golden patterns we've established.

Always use Makefile targets for running tests or builds, since they export the necessary env vars.

When commit messages mention AI agents, always use `Assisted-By`, never use `Co-Authored-By`.

When writing CSS, use modern native syntax including nesting, :has, layers, and light-dark()
