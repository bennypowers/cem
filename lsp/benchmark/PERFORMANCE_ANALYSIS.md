# LSP Performance Analysis: cem vs wc-toolkit (Updated)

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive benchmarking with **all 9 benchmark modules** and bug fixes applied, both LSP servers demonstrate **excellent reliability and performance**. The analysis reveals complementary strengths rather than clear superiority.

## Benchmark Investigation Results ‚úÖ

### Critical Finding: Previous "Crashes" Were Benchmark Bugs
The investigation revealed that reported "crashes" in diagnostics and edit cycles were actually **benchmark implementation errors**, not server failures:

1. **Edit Cycles "Crash"**: Invalid column positions in test data (`col=40` on 23-character line)
2. **Diagnostics "Failure"**: Incorrect LSP protocol usage (`publishDiagnostics` is server‚Üíclient, not client‚Üíserver)
3. **Server Capability Mismatch**: Treating missing features as failures instead of unsupported capabilities

## Current Performance Results (After Fixes)

### Overall Reliability
- **cem LSP**: 100% success rate (9/9 benchmarks pass)
- **wc-toolkit LSP**: 100% success rate (9/9 benchmarks pass)

The comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that both servers are excellent choices with **100% reliability**, and the decision should be based on specific performance requirements rather than general assumptions about architectural superiority.

## Investigation Impact

This analysis demonstrates the importance of:
1. **Proper LSP Protocol Understanding**: Following specification exactly
2. **Realistic Test Data**: Ensuring benchmark scenarios match actual usage
3. **Server Capability Detection**: Distinguishing unsupported features from failures
4. **Comprehensive Debugging**: Investigating root causes rather than assuming crashes
5. **Configuration Accuracy**: Ensuring test environments match production server setups

### Configuration Issues Resolved ‚úÖ
- **wc-toolkit Configuration**: **FIXED** - The issue was using the wrong server binary (`bin/wc-language-server.js` instead of `dist/server.js` from built VS Code extension) and missing TypeScript SDK initialization. With correct configuration, wc-toolkit achieves 100% benchmark reliability and full diagnostics support.

### Key Configuration Fixes Applied
1. **Proper Server Binary**: Use `packages/vscode/dist/server.js` (built from VS Code extension) instead of standalone `bin/wc-language-server.js`
2. **TypeScript SDK Integration**: Added `initializationOptions.typescript.tsdk` with proper TypeScript library path
3. **Build Process**: Run `npm run build` in VS Code extension directory to generate complete server with Volar framework
4. **Root Markers**: Include `wc.config.js` for proper wc-toolkit project detection

The corrected benchmarks now provide accurate performance insights demonstrating both servers are excellent with 100% reliability.
