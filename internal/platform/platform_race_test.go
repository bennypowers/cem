// This file contains tests for concurrent operations using Go 1.25's testing/synctest package.
//
// These tests previously had issues with Go's race detector "hole in findfunctab" limitation,
// but Go 1.25's synctest package provides proper isolation for concurrent testing scenarios.
//
// The synctest package provides:
// - Isolated "bubble" environments for concurrent tests
// - Virtual time that advances when goroutines block
// - Proper synchronization primitives for testing concurrent code
//
// This resolves the previous race detector issues with channel operations in mocks.
